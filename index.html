          Hi, I'm Emmanuel F. Borjal!

        </h1>
        <p>
          I am a seasoned full stack developer with a solid foundation in PHP,
          JavaScript, and TypeScript. Over the past few years, I've honed my
          skills in developing both backend and frontend solutions, with a
          particular focus on ReactJS, NodeJS, and Laravel. My experience spans
          across various industries, where I've contributed to building scalable
          applications, leveraging AWS cloud technologies, and
          integrating advanced tools like Mapbox GL JS. I'm passionate about
          fostering collaborative environments and consistently delivering
          high-quality solutions that drive business success.
